# BuzzLock
The most secure door lock. <br/>
Team members: Rishov Sarkar, Joshua Shafran, Andrew Gauker, and Celeste Smith

Living in the dorms and having to carry around a key can be annoying. Students lose their keys all the time and they take up space. So with the BuzzLock you can use Bluetooth and/or a BuzzCard** to unlock your door, no key required!

** Any magnetic stripe card can be used for authentication. **

The automatic keyboard for editing text fields such as name, phone number, PIN, etc. is provided using <a href="http://t-sato.in.coocan.jp/xvkbd/">xvkbd</a> and the command line from C#.
