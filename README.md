<b> Team members: Rishov Sarkar, Joshua Shafran, Andrew Gauker, and Celeste Smith</b><br/>
The most secure door lock. <br/>

Living in the dorms and having to carry around a key can be annoying. Students lose their keys all the time and they take up space. So with the BuzzLock you can use Bluetooth and/or a BuzzCard** to unlock your door, no key required!

** Any magnetic stripe card can be used for authentication. **
